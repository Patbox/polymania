# 0.2.1
- You can now join the modpack server with 1.21.2/3.
  - While it should faily playable, there might be some issues/bugs related to that, as features/behaviour between these versions have some differences. 
  - For best experience, you should play on 1.21.1 client, until the Polymania fully moves to 1.21.3 (with 0.3.0 update).
  - Some known issues are:
	- Walking on all blocks sounds like stone.
	- ComputerCraft mouse movement is broken.
	- Some display-entity blocks don't display correctly when upside down (e.g. Fans and Portable Fluid Tanks).
	- Some items have incorrect names and drinking/eating visuals (e.g. Brewery Brews).

  - They might get fixed in meantime in later patch, as ViaVersion gets issues fixed.
